# Prompt Engineering Library

This directory contains a comprehensive collection of AI prompts, personas, and system instructions, organized for easy reference and study.

## Directory Structure

### 1. `gemini-structured/`
**High-Quality Structured Prompts**
Originally from the "Awesome Gemini Prompts" collection. These prompts demonstrate advanced techniques like "Structured Prompting" (LangGPT style), often using Markdown headers, constraints, and initialization steps to create robust personas.
*   **Best for:** Learning how to build complex, reliable agents.
*   **Language:** Predominantly Chinese (Simplified).

### 2. `gpts-personas/`
**GPT Store Personas**
A massive collection of system prompts reversed-engineered or leaked from the OpenAI GPT Store. These files represent individual "GPTs" designed for specific tasks (e.g., coding, writing, gaming).
*   **Best for:** Analyzing real-world agent definitions and role-play instructions.
*   **Format:** Markdown files, usually one per persona.

### 3. `system-tools/`
**Commercial Tool System Prompts**
The system instructions that power major AI coding tools and assistants.
*   **Includes:** Anthropic (Claude), Cursor, GitHub Copilot, V0, etc.
*   **Best for:** Understanding how to instruct models for technical tasks and code generation.

### 4. `collections/`
**Prompt Collections**
Aggregated lists of prompts.
*   `awesome-chatgpt-prompts.md`: A large list of community-contributed role-play prompts.

### 5. `resources/`
**Documentation**
Guides and reference materials, such as the *Gemini for Google Workspace Prompting Guide*.

## Usage
*   **To find a prompt:** Browse the relevant subdirectory based on your need (Structure study vs. Role inspiration).
*   **To use a prompt:** Copy the content of the Markdown file and paste it into your LLM chat interface.
*   **Note:** Some prompts are optimized for specific models (Gemini vs. GPT-4), but most techniques are transferable.
